Title: Access USPTO Bulk Data in Tidy Rectangular Format
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R:
    c(person(given = "Raoul",
             family = "Wadhwa",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "raoulwadhwa@gmail.com"),
    person(given = "James",
           family = "Yu",
           role = "aut"),
    person(given = "Peter",
           family = "Erdi",
           role = "aut"))
Description: Converts TXT and XML data curated by the United States Patent and
    Trademark Office (USPTO). Allows conversion of bulk data after downloading
    directly from the USPTO bulk data website, eliminating need for users to
    wrangle multiple data formats to get large patent databases in tidy,
    rectangular format. Data details can be found on the USPTO website
    <https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/>. Currently, only TXT data (1976-2001)
    conversion is implemented; XML formats are in the process of being added.
