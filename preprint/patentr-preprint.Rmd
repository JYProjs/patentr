abstract: |
  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) hosts a public database containing searchable information on every patent issued in the United States since 1976.
  The USPTO website provides access to individual patents and permits download of bulk data files, each of which contains information on every patent issued in a given week.
  However, between 1976 and 2020, USPTO uses 3 distinct formats for bulk data files, creating a challenge for accessing the data contained within.
  To our knowledge, there were no software packages to access textual patent information from the USPTO and convert them to a rectangular data format that also shared an interface across the R and Python programming languages.
  Here, we introduce the `patentr` R package to fill this niche.
  The open source code for `patentr` and for this reproducible report can be found at \url{https://github.com/JYProjs/patentr}.
